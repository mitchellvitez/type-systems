# Type Systems

More and more, I've found that a high-quality type system is what makes or breaks my programming experience. There's a lot that a great type system can do automatically to remove tedium from the programmer's job, and I love things that are automatically correct. So this is a repo for playing with type systems!

Some content adapted from Pierce's excellent _Types and Programming Languages_, but translated into Haskell and reorganized
